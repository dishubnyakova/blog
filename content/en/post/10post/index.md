##   Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. It generally has small programs when compared to Java and C. It was founded in 1991 by developer Guido Van Rossum. Python ranks among the most popular and fastest-growing languages in the world. Python is a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use language. In addition, the python community is very active. It is used in many organizations as it supports multiple programming paradigms. It also performs automatic memory management.
Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.

## Advantages of **Python**: 

- Presence of third-party modules 
- Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics, etc.) 
- Open source and large active community base 
- Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write
- User-friendly data structures 
- High-level language 
- Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on the value assigned, it takes data type) 
- Object-Oriented and Procedural  Programming language
- Portable and Interactive
- Ideal for prototypes – provide more functionality with less coding
- Highly Efficient(Python’s clean object-oriented design provides enhanced process control, and the language is equipped with excellent text processing and integration capabilities, as well as its own unit testing framework, which makes it more efficient.)
- Internet of Things(IoT) Opportunities
- Interpreted Language
- Portable across Operating systems
